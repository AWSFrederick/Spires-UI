## Spires GIS Data Export UI

Just a quick map UI starting point.

Drag or resize the bounding box, select 'filter', then select which data set to export and then 'export'. The UI will generate the url for the export but not make the call yet. This still needs to be hooked up.

Don't forget to fill in your own Google API key.

Hack away.
